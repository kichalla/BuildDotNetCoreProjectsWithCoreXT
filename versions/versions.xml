  This is your versions file.  You can control assembly and file versions independently, and you can have
  multiple different versioning nodes in here.  Projects define the following to choose their version:
    <AssemblyVersionName>asmver</...>
    <AssemblyFileVersionName>filever</...>

  Generally, you want a granular filever, and an asmver that locks to major.minor.0.0 for binding purposes.

  Your build host will determine how you rev or dynamically control the versions for increasing values
  and uniqueness.
